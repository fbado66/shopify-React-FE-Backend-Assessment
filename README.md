# SnapUpy

SnapUpy is a web application that allows the users to buy and sell products online. 
<br>
<a href='https://snapupy.netlify.app/'><img src='public/readMeImages/homepage.png' alt='homepage' /></a>

Users are able to search all products on the site without the need to log in or register. At the moment they decided to purchase a good, the system will prompt them to sign in, if they are not.
<br>
Once the user is signed in, they will be able to check an inventory that will show, thier products, their purchases, and the goods they sold. In here the user is asked to create products so other users can buy them. 

## A Walkthrough on this application

The first thing you will see when using this application is the home page. <br/>

you can create a new product

<br>
The moment you are logged in, and you have created a product, if you go and browse through all the products, the system will allow you to buy only products that are not yours

If you click the add to cart button, you then get redirect to the cart component

and when you finish the transaction, the rest gets recorded in the inventory space as such

<br>
The moment another user buys one of your products, you will be able to see it in the inventory dashboard

<br>
<br>
This is a great project where there is room for improvement. 

## Build Status
Working progress <br/>
The core functionalities are present, but the system has some glitches that will time I will be able to fix. I have also created this project with room for growth in the future, so the structure of this application is flexible, where more functionality will come in the near future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`



Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
