Users are able to search all products on the site without the need to log in or register. At the moment they decided to purchase a good, the system will prompt them to sign in, if they are not.
<br>
Once the user is signed in, they will be able to check an inventory that will show, thier products, their purchases, and the goods they sold. In here the user is asked to create products so other users can buy them. 

## A Walkthrough on this application

<br>
This is a great project where there is room for improvement. 

## Build Status
Working progress <br/>
The core functionalities are present, but the system has some glitches that will time I will be able to fix. I have also created this project with room for growth in the future, so the structure of this application is flexible, where more functionality will come in the near future.
